# CIS194

Work done for CIS194 class from UPenn.

Done as the first part of the [Learn Haskell Series] (https://github.com/bitemyapp/learnhaskell)


[Class available online] (http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~cis194/spring13/lectures.html)

I'm not necessarily following the Spring 13 version of the course.  I've started the Week 1 Homework from the most current class (Spring 15).
